## 1. Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive business performance analysis for XXXX Co. Ltd., a retail company operating internationally. The analysis leverages transactional data to identify key trends, customer behavior patterns, and areas for strategic improvement. The goal is to provide actionable insights that will drive business growth, enhance customer retention, and optimize marketing efforts.

## 2. Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

*   Assess the overall financial performance of XXXX Co. Ltd.
*   Identify key customer segments and their purchasing behavior.
*   Determine the most successful products and markets.
*   Evaluate customer retention rates and churn patterns.
*   Provide data-driven recommendations to improve profitability and customer loyalty.

## 3. Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is a CSV file named `Online Retail.csv`. This file contains transactional data related to sales, including:

*   Invoice Number
*   Stock Code
*   Product Description
*   Quantity
*   Invoice Date
*   Unit Price
*   Customer ID
*   Country

## 4. Methodology

This analysis followed a structured methodology to ensure accuracy and relevance:

### Data Cleaning

The initial data cleaning process included:

*   **Handling Missing Values:** Removal of records with missing `CustomerID` as these were essential for customer-centric analysis.
*   **Removing Returns:** Elimination of transactions with negative `Quantity`, representing returns, to focus on sales patterns.
*   **Data Type Conversion:** Ensuring proper data types (e.g., converting `InvoiceDate` to datetime format) for accurate calculations and analysis.

### Feature Engineering

New features were engineered to facilitate deeper insights:

*   **`TotalRevenue` Calculation:** Computed by multiplying `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` to determine the value of each transaction.
*   **`CohortMonth` Derivation:** Extracted the month of each customer's first purchase to track customer acquisition cohorts.
*   **`CohortIndex` Calculation:** Determined the number of months since a customer's first purchase to measure customer retention over time.

### Analysis Techniques

The following analysis techniques were applied:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Provided a summary of the dataset, including key metrics like average revenue per transaction and average quantity sold.
*   **Time Series Analysis:** Visualized sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns and promotional impacts.
*   **Country-Based Analysis:** Compared sales performance across different countries to highlight key markets.
*   **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis:** Segmented customers based on their purchase history to identify high-value and at-risk segments.
*   **K-Means Clustering:** Segmented customers beyond RFM using clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns and customer groups.
*   **Cohort Analysis:** Tracked customer retention rates over time, providing insights into customer loyalty and churn.

## 5. Key Findings

*   **United Kingdom Market Dominance:** The UK is the primary revenue driver for XXXX Co. Ltd.
*   **Top-Selling Products:** Stock codes `23843` and `23166` are the most popular products.
*   **Customer Segmentation:**
    *   Distinct customer segments exist based on RFM scores and clustering analysis.
    *   Cohort analysis reveals declining customer retention over time.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Opportunities exist to improve customer retention and engagement.
    *   Targeted marketing campaigns can be developed for specific customer segments.
    *   Supply chain and advertising improvements are needed to maintain customer engagement to avoid current customer dropoff behavior.

## 6. Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

*   **Focus on the UK Market:** Concentrate marketing efforts and resources in the UK.
*   **Optimize Product Portfolio:** Prioritize marketing and inventory management for top-selling products.
*   **Implement Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Develop personalized marketing strategies for different customer segments identified through RFM and clustering.
*   **Improve Customer Onboarding:** Create a strong onboarding process to enhance customer engagement and retention.
*   **Tailor Loyalty Programs:** Implement tailored customer programs to reward different value customers

## 7. Code and Libraries

This project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:

*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **numpy:** For numerical computations.
*   **matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
*   **seaborn:** For making statistical graphics in Python.
*   **scikit-learn:** For implementing K-Means clustering and data scaling.

The main script is `main.py` (or whatever you named your script), which performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## 8. Usage

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

3.  Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    *Note: Ensure that the `Online Retail.csv` file is in the correct directory or update the file path in the script.*

4.  Review the output:

    *   The script will generate several plots and print key analysis results to the console.
    *   The RFM segments will be saved into a CSV file name `rfm_segments.csv`.
